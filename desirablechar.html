<h1>Deep Blue Data meets the OSTP desirable characteristics of data repositories</h1>
<p>
    Deep Blue Data can help you meet the data sharing requirements of federal grants, as it meets most of the United States Office of Science and Technology Policy OSTP desirable characteristics of data repositories. Each of the characteristics in the document are organized into four main themes and each section below lists the categories within that theme and how Deep Blue Data specifically meets these requirements:
