<p>Thank you for using our data! All data in the Deep Blue Data repository are available to anyone for download
    without restriction, but before you get started, please remember:
</p>
<ul>
    <p><li><strong>Content downloaded from Deep Blue Data is provided "as is."</strong> Just as with published books
    or articles available through the library, the library only makes the content available. Although we run a virus
    check on deposit of the data, no check is 100% accurate or foolproof. We therefore cannot guarantee the accuracy,
    adequacy, quality, or completeness of content from Deep Blue Data, or that downloads are absolutely free of
    viruses or other harmful components.</li>

<p>There are two pathways you can use to download our data: downloading locally (</b>for smaller files) or
    downloading using Globus (for larger files).</p>


<h2 id = "download-local">Downloading Data: Smaller Files (Local)</h2>

<p>Most data within Deep Blue Data can be downloaded by simply navigating to the web page of the work of interest
    and clicking on the file(s) you want to download under the "Files" heading. You can also select "Download" on
    the "Select an Action" menu to the right of the file name. If you want to download all of a work’s files
    simultaneously, simply click "Download Zipped Dataset" under the "Download All Files" heading.</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/download_local.jpg" alt="Downloading files page with the 'Select Actions' dropdown highlighted, showing 'Download' or 'View Details' options, and a 'Download Zipped Dataset' button at the bottom of the page.">

<h2 id = "download-globus">Downloading Data: Larger Files (Globus)</h2>

<p>Most files on Deep Blue Data can be downloaded directly from the Work, but some files are so large that
    timeouts and errors can occur when trying to retrieve them through a browser.</p>

<p>To access these larger files, you can use <a href="https://www.globus.org/" target="_blank">Globus</a>. For those who use
    Deep Blue Data frequently, Globus also may end up serving as a more convenient way to access files of all
    types and sizes.</p>

<h3>What is Globus, and why do I need it to access files on Deep Blue Data?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.globus.org/what-we-do"target="_blank">Globus</a> is a nonprofit platform created by the University of
    Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory that enables the simple transfer of digital files as large as
    petabytes (a petabyte is 1,000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes) from established endpoints, one of which
    can be your work or personal computer.</p>

<h3>How do I set up Globus so I can transfer files to my computer?</h3>

<p>Below is a short guide for setting up Globus on your computer. Globus also has
    <a href="https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/" target="_blank">detailed "How To" walkthroughs</a> for basic and more
    complicated setup processes.</p>

<h3>Set up an account on Globus</h3>

<p>The first step is to set up an account with the Globus Web App, which can be connected to other personal and
    institutional accounts, including those at the University of Michigan. To begin setting up an account, navigate
    to the <a href="https://globus.org/login" target="_blank">Globus login page</a>.</p>

<img  src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/globus_login.jpg" alt="Globus login page with options to select origanization.">

<p>In the drop-down menu below "Use your existing organizational login," if the name of your institution is listed
    (e.g. University of Michigan), select it, click "Continue," and sign in using your institution’s login system.
    If your institution is not listed, or you would prefer to use a non-institutional email, click "Sign in with
    Google" below the "Continue" button. If you do not have a Google account, you may create an account using
    <a href="https://globusid.org/create" target="_blank">Globus ID</a>.</p>

<p>When you are asked if you want to link to an existing Globus account, click "Continue." You will then be prompted
    for some additional information, including how you plan to use Globus (i.e. for commercial or academic purposes),
    and you must agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>Install Globus Connect Personal</h3>

<p>Once you have set up a Globus account, you will want to establish a personal endpoint on your computer so that you
    can transfer data to it. To do this, you will need to download and install Globus Connect Personal, which will
    connect to the Globus Web App.</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/create_your_endpoint.jpg" alt="'Name your endpoint' page showing options to name, generate setup key, and download Globus Connect Personal.">

<p>To begin, navigate to <a href="https://app.globus.org/file-manager/gcp" target="_blank">https://app.globus.org/file-manager/gcp</a>.
    For Step 1 ("Name Your Endpoint"), provide a descriptive name for the endpoint that will help you identify it in
    the future (e.g., Sam's Personal Laptop). For step 2 ("Generate a Setup Key for Installation"), click
    "Generate Setup Key," copy the result, and keep it in your clipboard or paste it in another document. Then,
    select your operating system from those listed in "Step 3" ("Download & Install Globus Connect Personal")
    and complete the installation setup. Most default settings are satisfactory, though later you may want to
    change the folder, or directory, to which Globus sends transferred files. During the installation process
    (or when you first open the program, depending on your operating system), you will be asked to provide the
    Setup Key you copied earlier.</p>

<p>You can find detailed installation instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux operating systems at
    <a href="https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal" target="_blank">https://www.globus.org/globus-connect-personal</a>.
    On the instructions for Mac and Windows, the Configuration section will tell you how to change the folder that
    Globus can access. (In particular, you may need to set the destination folder as writable for transfers to
    be successful.)</p>

<h3>Now I have Globus set up. How do I get the files I want from Deep Blue Data?</h3>

<p>Once you have an account and Globus Connect Personal is installed on your computer, you have everything in place
    to begin transferring files from Deep Blue Data. Follow the steps below to complete the transfer process.</p>

<h3>Send files to Globus</h3>

<p>Return to the Work in Deep Blue Data from which you would like to transfer files to your computer. There will
    be a button labeled either "Send to Globus to Download" (image A, below) or "Link to Globus Download Directory"
    (image B) just beneath the list of files and the button labeled "Download All Files."</p>


<p>(A)</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/send_to_globus.jpg" alt="File download page showing all file names, those files' access types, and options to send all to Globus to Download.">

<p>(B)</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/globus_ready.jpg" alt="Link to Globus 'Download Directly' page, displayed to users if this setting was selected.">

<p>If there is a button labeled "Download Data from Globus" instead of "Send to Globus to Download," the files are
    already available for transfer because another user previously requested them. Click "Link to Globus download
    directory" and log in to your Globus account if prompted.</p>

<p>If there is a button labeled "Send to Globus to Download," click the button to begin the copying process.
    If prompted, log in to your Globus account. Globus will then prepare the files for download. How long the process
    will take depends on the size of the files.</p>

<p>If you are a University of Michigan affiliate and are logged into Deep Blue Data, you will automatically receive
    an email at your "@umich.edu" account when the files are ready for transfer. If you are NOT a University of
    Michigan affiliate and are not logged in to Deep Blue Data, a page will appear asking if you would like to
    provide your email address so that you can be notified when the files are available for transfer. That window
    will have two text boxes to fill ("Email" and "Email again"):</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/email_when_done.jpg" alt="Non-U-M affiliated message showing th einput field to write email.">

<p>If you would rather not provide your email, you can click "Don't Add My Email" and return to the page on Deep
    Blue Data later to see if the files are available. However, we highly recommend you provide Deep Blue Data with
    an email, since it may take some time for the files to be ready.</p>

<p>When you receive an email notifying you that the files are available in Globus, click the Globus link provided
    in the email. If you did not specify an email, return to the dataset page on Deep Blue Data to check if the
    "Send to Globus for Download" button has been replaced with the "Link to Globus for Download"; if so, click
    "Link to Globus for Download" to continue.</p>

<h3>Specify your device as an endpoint in Globus</h3>

<p>After you have either clicked the Globus link provided in your email or the "Link to Globus for Download" button
    in the Work on Deep Blue Data, a page titled "File Manager | Globus" should appear:</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/file_manager.jpg" alt="File manager page showing th elist of files and several interactive options on the right tool bar.">

<p>"DeepBlueData" should appear in the "Collection" field, which represents the main location for all of Deep Blue
    Data’s deposits on Globus. The "Path" field represents a unique pathway to the specific files for download.
    There is no need to alter anything in these two fields, since all the files for download should appear in the
    list below.</p>

<p>Click on the second "Panels" icon in the top-right corner. Alternatively, you can click on the icon with the
    tooltip "Transfer or Sync to…" on the right-hand icon menu in the single-panel view. In either case, a page
    with two "Collection" panels should appear:</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/select_collection.jpg" alt="File Manager page showing the 'Select a Collection' panel after clicking the double-panel view.">

<p>The second (right-hand) "Collection" panel represents your personal endpoint where the data will transfer, i.e.,
    your computer. Click "– select a collection –" in this field to select your endpoint. Then, you can either
    search for your personal computer in the search bar or find it under the "Your Collections" tab.
</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/select_my_computer.jpg" alt="File Manager page showing options to see recent, bookmarked, collections (highlighted in the image), shared with you, and more options.">

<p>In the "Your Collections" tab, your endpoint icon will be green (with the icon tooltip reading "collection ready")
    if your device is ready to download files from Globus. If the icon is red with an "x" (or if the icon tooltip reads
    "collection offline"), please check that Globus Connect Personal is running on your computer (for additional
    information onthis, please refer to
    <a href="https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started">https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started</a>).
</p>

<h3>Download files from Globus to your device</h3>

<p>After selecting your Collection endpoint, select the files you would like to download from the "DeepBlueData"
    collection in the first (left-most) panel. You may either click "select all" above the list of files or select
    only the files you would like to download.</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/select_all.jpg" alt="Select All button showed at the top left of the file manager files list.">

<p>In the second (right-hand) panel, select the location where you would like the files to save on your computer.
    If you do not select a location, Globus defaults to whatever location you previously set up in Globus Connect
    Personal.</p>

<p>When endpoints for both sides are set, the "Start" button below the list of "DeepBlueData" files will turn darker
    blue and will be clickable. Click on this "Start" button to download your files.</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/start_button.jpg" alt="Start button shown at the bottom of the File Manager page on the double panal view.">

<p>A message in a green bar (reading "Transfer request submitted successfully. Task id:...") should appear above
    the file window, indicating a successful transfer request. Because Globus is expected to handle large files
    that take some time to download, the platform is set up to pause whenever your computer is no longer connected
    to the Internet. It will resume automatically when your computer is reconnected.</p>

<p>Once the files have been completely downloaded, they will appear in the destination folder on your computer.
    You can always check the status of tasks by clicking "Activity" in the left-hand navigation on the Globus page
    where you set up your transfer. If you provided an email or are signed in with your U-M account, you will
    receive an email when the transfer has been completed.</p>

<img src="/data/work_view_content/DBDDoc-user-guide/transfer_success.jpg" alt="Left navigation showing the activity section highlighted.">

<h3>Where can I go if I need further help with Globus or Deep Blue Data?</h3>

<p>Globus has numerous How To guides on its <a href="https://docs.globus.org/how-to/">Globus Docs website</a>,
    including videos. You can also <a href="/data/contact">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3> Note about Globus</h3>

<p>By default, Globus Personal Connect will automatically turn on in the background when you start your computer.
    When you are not using Globus, to avoid receiving error messages and other notifications, simply find the Globus
    icon in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen (or in the menu/status bar at the top for Mac), right-click
    (or ctrl-click for Mac), and click "Quit Globus Personal Connect."</p>
